# Steps for Webpack

    # Connect to repo

    # Clone Repo
    `git clone git@github.com:irinaheimerle/webpack_base.git . `

    # Or connect to repo as a separate remote
    `git remote add webpack git@github.com:irinaheimerle/webpack_base.git`

    # Switch to the branch you're working in 
    `git pull webpack master`

    # Feel free to customize `package.json`

    # Run `npm install`

    # Adjust styles / javascript as needed

    # Run `npm run watch` to see changes / run scripts, etc.

    # Feel free to delete `webpack_index.php` once satisfied Webpack is running correctly.
